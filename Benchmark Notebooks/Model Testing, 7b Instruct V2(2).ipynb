      "    The Rule of 72 is a simple way to estimate the number of years it takes for an investment to double, given a fixed annual rate of return. To use the Rule of 72, subtract the number 72 from the expected annual return percentage and divide by 72. The result will be the approximate number of years it takes for the investment to double. For example, if an investment has an expected annual return of 8%, it would take approximately 9 years to double in value (72-8=64, 64/72=0.89 or approximately 9 years). This rule is often used in financial planning and investment analysis for quick estimates of the growth timeline of an investment.</s>\n"
