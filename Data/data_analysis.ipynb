They loan you the money. You make payments over months or years, if the total amount you pay is greater than what they paid for the car, plus their expenses, plus their finance expenses they make money. Of course the money takes years to come in, or they sell your loan to another business to get the money faster but in a smaller amount. You trade in a car and they sell it at a profit. Of course that new transaction could be a lump sum or a loan on the used car... They or course make money if you bring the car back for maintenance, or you buy lots of expensive dealer options. Some dealers wave two deals in front of you: get a 0% interest loan. These tend to be shorter 12 months vs 36,48,60 or even 72 months. The shorter length makes it harder for many to afford. If you can't swing the 12 large payments they offer you at x% loan for y years that keeps the payments in your budget. pay cash and get a rebate. If you take the rebate you can't get the 0% loan. If you take the 0% loan you can't get the rebate. The price you negotiate minus the rebate is enough to make a profit. The key is not letting them know which offer you are interested in. Don't even mention a trade in until the price of the new car has been finalized. Otherwise they will adjust the price, rebate, interest rate, length of loan,  and trade-in value to maximize their profit. The suggestion of running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a good one. If you get a loan for 2% from your bank/credit union for 3 years and the rebate from the dealer, it will cost less in total than the 0% loan from the dealer. The key is to get the loan approved by the bank/credit union before meeting with the dealer. The money from the bank looks like cash to the dealer.\n"

        "As we discussed, there are 4 steps to kicking off a fine-tuning job using the Predibase SDK:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Prepare your dataset (done above)\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section we will cover the following:\n",
        "2. Upload your dataset to Predibase - can be done either via importing a dataset already in memory like we have, or via file upload.\n",
        "3. Setup the fine-tuning prompt\n",
        "4. Kick-off fine-tuning and monitor the job\n",
        "\n",
        "Beneath the surface, Predibase uses **LoRA adapters** for fine-tuning with a quantized base model. LoRA adapters allow for efficient, light-weight learning by injecting a small set of learnable weights into the base model that are trainable. Not only does it have very comparable performance to full fine-tuning, but it is faster to train and also allows dynamically swapping models at inference time for cost-savings. There will be more about this after we finish fine-tuning."

            "1. First, we need to find out how much the total cost of the loan will be. This includes the initial loan amount and the interest that will accumulate over the loan period. The formula for calculating the total cost of a loan is:\n",
            "\n",
            "    Total Cost = Loan Amount + (Loan Amount * APR * Loan Term)\n",
            "\n",
            "2. In this case, the loan amount is $35,000, the APR is 5% (or 0.05 as a decimal), and the loan term will be determined by the number of $500 payments. Since we don't know the loan term yet, we'll call it 'n' for now.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. So, the total cost formula becomes:\n",
            "\n",
            "    Total Cost = $35,000 + ($35,000 * 0.05 * n)\n",
            "\n",
            "4. We know that each payment is $500, so the total number of payments (or the loan term) will be:\n",
            "\n",
            "    n = Total Cost / $500\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Now, we need to find a value for 'n' that will result in the total cost being completely paid off. This is a bit tricky because the total cost depends on 'n', and 'n' depends on the total cost. However, we can use a process of trial and error to find an approximate value for 'n'.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Let's start by guessing that 'n' is 70. That would mean there are 70 payments of $500 each. Plugging this into our total cost formula:\n",
            "\n",
            "    Total Cost = $35,000 + ($35,000 * 0.05 * 70)\n",

            "    Total Cost = $47,250\n",
            "\n",
            "7. This is more than the initial loan amount, but that's okay. It just means that our guess for 'n' was too low. We can repeat the process with a higher guess for 'n'. After a few iterations, we find that 'n' is approximately 84.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. So, it would take about 84 payments of $500 each to pay off a $35,000 loan with a 5% APR.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. First, we need to find out how much the total cost of the loan will be. This includes the original amount borrowed (the principal) and the interest that will accumulate over the life of the loan.\n",

            "2. The formula for calculating the total cost of a loan is:\n",
            "\n",
            "   Total Cost = Principal * (1 + (APR / number of payments per year))^(number of payments per year * number of years)\n",
            "\n",
            "3. In this case, the principal is $35,000, the APR is 5% (or 0.05 as a decimal), and the payment amount is $500, so we can assume that there are 35000 / 500 = 70 payments per year.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. However, the problem doesn't specify how many years the loan is for, so let's call the number of years \"n\".\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n",
            "\n",
            "   Total Cost = 35000 * (1 + (0.05 / 70))^(70 * n)\n",
            "\n",
            "6. To find the number of years it will take to pay off the loan, we need to set the Total Cost equal to zero and solve for n:\n",
            "\n",
            "   0 = 35000 * (1 + (0.05 / 70))^(70 * n)\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for n, we get:\n",
            "\n",
            "   n = ln(0) / (70 * ln(1 + (0.05 / 70)))\n",
            "\n",
            "8. However, this formula will give us an error because the natural logarithm of zero is undefined. This means that it's not possible to pay off the loan with $500 payments alone.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. If we want to find out how long it would take to pay off the loan if we increased the payment amount, we could use a similar formula, but with a different payment amount.\n",
